# CoolBookProj

Coolest project ever :) 

start mysql server and import the database there

open project with intellij, if mysql server has password and different kind of username, please go to applications.properties and change things respectively. click on start and enjoy the show.

  ## Consider:

First user created is not an admin, and as it is a first user, no one can change it's permissions to admin from website. go to database and change isadmin_not property of the user from 0 to 1. after that go to website, click on log in, and log in again.
